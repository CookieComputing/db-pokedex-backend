# db-pokedex-backend

Backend for CS 3200 - Database Design. Contains code for querying PokeAPI, as well as servicing requests to the MySQL database.

## Onboarding

- You'll need to ensure `python3` is installed on your systems. If you're on MacOS, the command is `brew install python`. If you're on some *nix system, the command is probably `sudo apt-get install python3`
- Create `pokedex/.env`. This file will be used for storing various configuration values you may need to start the server. Here's an example of a file:
```
DATABASE_USER=<yourDBuser, e.g. root>
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<yourDBpassword, e.g. pass>
DATABASE_NAME=pokedex
DATABASE_HOST=<yourDBhost, e.g. localhost>
```
- Create a virtual environment to remove any dependencies your machine may have, i.e. `python3 -m venv env`
- Run `source env/bin/activate` in the main directory to enable your virtual environment
- Run `pip install requirements.txt` in the main directory to install python requirements

## Starting the backend server
- Ensure you're in the virtual environment with the requirements already installed
- Open up a terminal and run `make run` in the root directory
- To verify that the server is connected, visit the localhost page they provided in the output of your terminal, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
